        <h1><b>A/B TESTING</b></h1>


        <h2><b>Background</b></h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">I created two different versions of the original cactus-shopping website, "cact-I +
            cact-you =
            cact-us" by adding different changes to it. For version A, I changed the website name to "Cactus Store" and
            bold-faced the font throughout the entire page. The price is written below the product description. Version
            B
            retains the original website name, with only its price bold-faced. Its
            price is kept right next to the product description.<br><br>My main goal of this A/B testing is to determine
            whether two different
            websites with different website names, font bold-facedness, and price location (below or next to product
            description) show a statistically significant difference in the user's time to complete the task of
            ordering
            over $150 worth of cacti and the user's return rate to the ordering page after checking the cart.</p><br>
        <div class="center-box">
            <h4>Version A</h4>
            <p>
                <img class="img-rounded" src="../img/abtesting_img/Website A.png" width="70%"></p><br>
            <h4>Version B</h4>
            <p>

        <h2><b>Hypotheses for Statistical Tests</b></h2>
        <div class="center-box">
            <h4><b>Time to Completion</b></h4>
            <h5><b>Null Hypothesis:</b></h5>
        </div>

        <p>The time it takes to complete the task of ordering over $150 worth of cacti does not differ between A and B.
        </p>
        <div class="center-box">
            <h5><b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b></h5>
        </div>
        <p>The time it takes to complete the task of ordering over $150 worth of cacti differs between A and B.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="center-box">
            <h4><b>Return Rate</b></h4>
            <h5><b>Null Hypothesis:</b></h5>
        </div>
        <p>The users' return rate to the ordering page after checking the cart does not differ between A and B.</p>
        <div class="center-box">
            <h5><b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b></h5>
        </div>
        <p>The users' return rate to the ordering page after checking the cart differs between A and B.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="center-box">
            <h4><b>Reasoning behind the alternative hypotheses</b></h4>
        </div>
        <p>Since I wish to see if the two websites produce statistically significantly different time to completion and
            return rate, and not to see if one website produces a longer/shorter time to completion and greater/smaller
            return rate (since I did not create the design changes expecting one to perform better than the other), I
            will
            be using a two tail test. Through this test, I want to determine if there is a statistically significant
            difference in time to completion and return rate between A and B in either direction. Thus, the alternative
            hypotheses state that the two variables simply "differ" between A and B, not "less than" or "greater than."
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h2><b>Data Collection and Data Crunching</b></h2>
        <p>
            In order to collect the data, I deployed two versions of the website on Heroku. The Heroku link
            randomly selected interface A or B for users to test. Each user either got A or B chosen randomly, and they
            were
            asked to fill their cart with at least $150 of cacti. <br><br>
            Then, I extracted the filtered log containing the time stamp, version, page load time, click time, id of
            clicked
            element (cactus), and session ID for each user. I calculated the time to completion by subtracting page load
            time from the click time for each distinct session ID. I also used the very last page load time as the end
            time
            if
            the user returned to the page and included the users who clicked regardless of whether the amount added is
            at
            least $150. For the return rate, I counted the number of testers on A who
            returned to the original cactus-ordering page after checking the cart and who did not, and the same for B as
            well. <br><br>
            I had 25 data points in total, yet the very first data point was cut off, and two were invalid because the
            users
            did not click
            any buttons after loading
            the websites. Since the first data point provides insufficient data (and can possibly become an unintended
            outlier) and the other two are invalid, as they have mixed websites without any actions taken, those three
            data
            points were removed.
            Out of the remaining
            22
            users, 9 users tested
            on version A, and the remaining 13 users tested on
            version B. The first table below shows time to completion, page visited, and whether a user loaded both
            versions. The second table then categorizes the data points for time to completion into A and B and also
            shows
            the number of users who returned to the original ordering page after checking the cart and the number of
            those
            who did not for both version A and version B. <br><br>
            An interesting point observed was that, as the last column of the first table indicates, some users loaded
            both
            versions A and B. Then, after alternating between the two versions, they either exited or chose one version
            to
            proceed to testing. One user actually tested both versions A and B, with some time in between, as noted in
            the
            first table.

        <h2><b>Test Types</b></h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">Two-sample t-test was chosen for the time to completion for version A and B, as
            it is numerical data.<br>
            Chi-square test was chosen for the return rate for version A and B, as it is categorical data.</p>
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        <h2><b>Additional Conclusion Points</b></h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 80px">
            The results tell us that the small changes applied based on the design principles and components, such as
            emphasis
            (font bold-facedness),
            alignment (price
            location), proportion, balance, etc., do not result in significant impact on users' ability to navigate
            through
            the website between multiple pages or to complete simple tasks.<br><br>
            In general, I think the repetition of the same task over forty different websites for each user might have
            made
            their time
            to completion and return rate
            relatively
            uninfluenced by changes made on the original website, which could have suppressed the more variable data we
            were
            seeking for significance
            testing.
            <br><br>
            Based on the conclusions, I would not favor one website over the other when deploying. I would need more
            testing, since
            the test was inconclusive.
