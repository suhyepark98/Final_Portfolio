        <h2><b>Goals & Values</b></h2>
        One of the main goals of the application is to show various options for the clothing products from
        Adidas and
        allow the users to
        shop for clothes easily. Specifically, the website conveniently displays products that match each
        user’s needs/interests by applying filters based on two different categories, including "Gender"
        (All / Men /
        Women) and "Type" (All / Sweatshirts / Jackets / T-shirts / Pants), as well as sorting the products
        based on
        "Price" (Lowest to Highest / Highest to Lowest). This will reduce the amount of time and effort the
        user ends up
        wasting by trying to search for wanted items through an unfiltered, unsorted list of numerous items.
        The
        difficulty increases with an increasing number of products presented by the website.
        <br><br>
        Also, the application allows the users to store items they are interested in inside the cart. This
        can easily be
        done through the "Add to Cart," "Remove from Cart," "Add Quantity," and "Subtract Quantity" buttons.
        "Add to Cart" is present for each item on the product options secton of the website, which shows the
        filtered
        and sorted products, and the other three are present for each item added to the cart. If an item to
        be added
        does not already exist in the cart, it is newly added with a default quantity of 1. If it already
        exists, the
        quantity of the product is increased by 1 every time "Add to Cart" is clicked. Similarly, once in
        the cart, a
        product can be removed altogether through the "Remove from Cart" button, and the quantity of a
        product can be
        increased by 1 every time the "Add Quantity" (shown as up arrow) button is clicked, and decreased by
        1 every
        time the "Subtract Quantity" (shown as down arrow) button is clicked. This allows the users to
        easily manage
        their cart.
        <br><br>
        The overall goal of the website is to give the users the best experience possible in shopping for
        clothes by
        making the interface as convenient, easy to use, and intuitive as possible.
        <br><br>

        <br>
        <h2><b>Usability Principles</b></h2>

        The "My Cart" section indicating the user's customizable cart is placed right adjacent to the
        product options
        section. This allows the users to see both the product section and the cart at one sight, without
        having
        to scroll down unnecessarily to the very bottom of the product section or
        navigate to a completely
        different page to review their cart. The users can also quickly remember what has been put inside
        their
        cart in case they forget and compare those in the cart with other products in the product section.
        This can
        therefore
        make the users' online shopping experience effective and effortless and minimize the number of
        clicks necessary
        to navigate through different components of the website.
        <br><br>
        The proximity of the "My Cart" section from the starting page is also deeply
        connect with Fitts's law, which states that the amount of time required for a person to move a
        pointer to a
        target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. In other
        words, the
        shorter the distance and the greater the target’s size, the quicker it takes to reach it. Thus,
        since the users
        will most
        likely be using their mouse cursors as their location input source, they can easily reach the cart
        because it is
        placed
        as closely as possible to the center of the starting page, or to the center of the screen.
        <br><br>
        Also, the navigation bars for the filters and the dropdown button for the sorting options are chosen
        to be on
        top of the product options section to
        make the functionalities easily detectable by the users, so they
        can benefit from them.
        <br><br>
        The website also displays each product in its own box surrounded by a thin black border. This is to
        minimize the
        potential confusion about which product a button belongs to and make the products clearly
        distinguishable from
        each other, as we are treating all pieces of information about one product as one entity.
        <br><br>
        All of the components of the website are made to be straightforward and intuitive. It is so that no
        user will
        be confused about what a certain functionality achieves or how to utilize a certain feature. All of
        the buttons,
        navigation bars, dropdown, and sections have clear labels that are easily detectable (e.g. through
        contrasting
        color
        from the background for emphasis and visibility), and all components are
        self-explanatory. Also, the colors used for the website match well with each other and present great
        contrast
        for emphasis among different components of the website.

        <br>
        <h2><b>Architecture of React App</b></h2>
        This "Adidas Online Shopping" app is built mainly from three different files: App.js,
        FilteredList.js,
        DisplayList.js.
        <br><br>
        When App is called, the React app is started. Inside it, we initialize the list of product items,
        each of which
        is defined by id, name, gender, type, price, and image. The list is then passed into the
        FilteredList component
        as props.
        <br><br>
        FilteredList is a component that uses this list and constructs the content portion of the website,
        including the
        navbars for filters, the dropdown for sorting options, the product options section, and the cart
        section.
        Specifically, it performs filtering based on "Gender" and "Type" and sorting based on "Price" to
        only display
        matching products. When a user switches to a different option for any of the filters or the sort
        method, the
        corresponding implemented onSelect method is called to cause the state change (on gender, type, or
        sort).
        <br><br>
        Aggregator functionality is implemented in this class as well to calculate the total price of the
        products in
        the cart. "Add to Cart," "Remove from Cart," "Add Quantity," and "Subtract Quantity" functions are
        built. The
        total price in the cart is calculated in this class as well, using the state cart dictionary.
        <br><br>
        When DisplayList is called inside FilteredList to get the product display (for either the products
        options or
        the cart), the four aforementioned call-back functions are passed as well as the list of product
        options or the
        cart dictionary, and whether it is a cart. This boolean is needed because the info display for a
        product have
        different buttons for the product options and the cart. Also, the four call-back functions are used
        to trigger
        state changes when the user clicks on any of the four buttons ("Add to Cart," "Remove from Cart,"
        "Add
        Quantity," and "Subtract Quantity"), which calls the corresponding onClick function that calls the
        call-back
        function, which traces back to FilteredList to cause a state change in that class (on the cart
        dictionary).
