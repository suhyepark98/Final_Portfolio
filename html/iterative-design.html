                Statiq is a company based in the New Delhi suburb of Gurugram, India, and founded in October 2019.
            </p>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                It allows individuals and buildings to provide EV (electric vehicle) charging points through its
                app.
            </p>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                Its motivation is to mitigate air pollution from automobile exhaust by encouraging the use of EVs.
            </p>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                Statiq has a multi-revenue model. End users buy a subscription from Statiq to use the network and
                pay a
                fee per charging session, which gets split between Statiq and the property owner. This gives
                landlords who install the stations an incremental revenue boost.
            </p>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                Statiq has installed more than 150 charging stations in Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai and the
                surrounding
                environments.

            <p class="lead ma-5">
                We decided to design a mobile app for the startup due to the following reasons:
            <ul>
                <li> Users will most likely be using the app when they're on the road,
                    looking for EV-charging stations nearby.</li>
                <li>Users can use the map and navigation features of the app to get to the chosen
                    stations using the phone.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h4><b>Features: </b></h4>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                The app would have a Google Maps-like interface to show various charging options near the user's
                current location and show
                the availability, waiting time, distance, rating, types of EV that can be charged, and a
                navigation feature to bring the user to the station.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Target Users: </b></h4>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                Anyone who owns an electric vehicle could benefit from this interface as it helps them locate
                charging stations faster and make reservations easier.

                We merged selected pages & designs from each set of sketches to build an interface that demonstrates
                our solution to the
                startup's goal of reducing pollution by connecting the users & owners of EV charging stations.
            </p>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                The sets of sketches are diverse and creative, and each brings distinct components and ideas, such
                as map,
                navigation, profile, reservation, and history pages, as well as sub-components such as spots
                available and
                waiting time. <br>
                We incorporated all of these critical features into once interface, as shown below.</p>
            <p class="lead ma-5">
                We categorized each functionality into groups, and designed a navigation bar at the bottom that

                            service for customers.</li>
                        <li>Since we are providing an application that allows people to pay to charge EVs, it might

                            to show them how much they are spending as well.</li>

                            like it is not as crucial as a function, and could still be done by looking through
                            their own charging

                <p class="lead ma-5">
                    The main task we gave was for the users to complete a reservation procedure, which is the main
                    functionality of our app.
                </p>
                <p class="lead ma-5">
                    We broke down our main task into sub-tasks, which are actions that users should take on each
                    screen in order to successfully make a reservation
                </p>
                <p class="lead ma-5 mb-5">
                    We observed that users typically made <b>little to no errors</b> and have no trouble navigating
                    through the process on their first try. Some of them are confused as to
                    why a payment component of app is needed, but that is due to the fact that the business model of
                    Statiq was not fully communicated to users as background knowledge
                    before they started the test.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pa-5 pb-3 my-3 display-5 text-left"><b>Objective Completetion</b></h4>
                <p class="lead ma-5">
                    The fact that most users were able to successfully complete the task on the first try, some even
                    without needing to consult the sub-tasks, shows that
                    the interface is intuitive enough and has good affordances that allows users to know how to go
                    from one step to the next.
                </p>
                <p class="lead ma-5 mb-5">
                    This falls largely in line with our expectations based on the similar positive feedbacks
                    received in the group crit studio. Some problems, such as more clarity regarding
                    what the navigation function would look like, was also brought up during user testing.
                </p>
                <h4 class="pa-5 pb-3 my-3 display-5 text-left"><b>Potential Changes</b></h4>
                <p class="lead ma-5">
                    Besides changing the navigation text instructions from "Swipe Up to Naviage" to "Swipe Up to
                    Enter Navigation Mode" to make it clear that navigation is a separate functionality
                    that is different than the maps homepage, we could also consider adding an additional screen in
                    our hi-fi mockup to showcase what the specific page would look like to users.
                </p>
                <p class="lead ma-5">
                    We have also included the names of different functions under the icons in the bottom navigation
                    bar, so the purpose of each icon and where it might take the user would be clear
                    even to people who are using the application for the first time.
